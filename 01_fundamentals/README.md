## Datatypes

1 - Primitive Datatypes

a - Number --> 23, 15.362, -1
b - Strings --> "sequence Of Characters"
c - Boolean --> True / False

d - Undefined --> value of a variable not yet defined (empty Value)
e - Null --> intentional empty value
f - Symbol --> unique and can nt be changed
g - BigInt --> numbers larger than +/-(2^52 - 1)

## **_ Javascript is a dynamically typed laguage, that means we do not have to explicitly define the data type of the value stored in a variable. Instead, datatypes are determined automatically. _**

Value has a Datatype, not the variable in which it is stored.

2 - Object types

### typeof null is object
